## the programs included are used for calculating and minimizing joint compliance of three degree of freedom planaer link robot having three links##

Description:

1. The robot is a planar link robot 
2. The joint compliance is calculated as a matrix for the three joints 
3. The joint compliance is minimized to find the minimum deflections 
4. Two matlab functions, fmincon and fminsearch can be used to minimize, both use different optimization minimization algorithms. 



* the force matrix is take of ones vector for simplicity, it can be changed in the code. 
* compliance can be calculated by two methods which are described in the code. 
* the respository also contains an excel program for joint compliance minimization.
